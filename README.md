DuckPAN (https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-app-duckpan) is an application built to provide developers a testing environment for DuckDuckHack Instant Answers (http://duckduckhack.com). It allows you to test instant answer triggers and preview their visual design and output.

This project provides a Vagrant-based development setup for DuckPAN.

### Installation

1. Install Vagrant: http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html

2. Clone this repo

3. Review the CUSTOM_CONFIG settings at the top of Vagrant file.  You will want to customize the value of the synced directory to point to your local directory containing the DuckDuckGo code you wish to test.  By default, Vagrant will load a VirtualBox Precise64 (http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box) machine image.  If you change this, DuckDuckGo recommends Ubuntu (https://github.com/duckduckgo/p5-app-duckpan#disclaimer).

4. Run `vagrant up`

The box takes some time to stand up.
